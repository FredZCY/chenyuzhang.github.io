Data scientist at Morgan Stanley, specializing in advanced machine learning techniques for complex business problem-solving. Master's degree in Data Science from Johns Hopkins University.

Collaborative team player experienced in leveraging cutting-edge technologies for strategic initiatives. Effective communicator, translating technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders. Committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in data science such as LLMs.

I find it exhilarating to parse through the data tangle and endow it with value, and I am eager to uncover the hidden insights that lie beneath the surface of raw data troves generated every single day.
