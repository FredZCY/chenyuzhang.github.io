Data scientist at Morgan Stanley, specializing in advanced machine learning techniques for complex business problem-solving. Master's degree in Data Science from Johns Hopkins University.

Collaborative team player experienced in leveraging cutting-edge technologies for strategic initiatives. Effective communicator, translating technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders. Committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in data science such as LLMs.

I find it exhilarating to parse through the data tangle and endow it with value, and I am eager to uncover the hidden insights that lie beneath the surface of raw data troves generated every single day.

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
